    <h1>A Line from Noise</h1>
    
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>A generative graphic score process that offers performers the opportunity to curate from generated options a unique score that they can interpret. The scores are considered miniatures that are characterised by the poetic prompts that start each section.</p>

    <div class="link-box">
        <a href="lineInNoise1.2.html">Open the Score Generator</a>
    </div>

    <h2>How to Use</h2>
    <p><strong>Navigation:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click on the left half of the screen to go backwards</li>
        <li>Click on the right half of the screen to advance to the next screen</li>
        <li>Press the 'F' key to toggle fullscreen mode</li>
        <li>In performance, the selected screens can be advanced using foot switches</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Curating a score:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Navigate through the generated screens to find visual and textual material that resonates.</li>
        <li>Each screen sequence is unique - and a performer can find a miniature which is screen series that starts with a text prompt and goes until the next text prompt.</li>
        <li>When working with performers the composer will develop a method for selecting and performing miniatures as is most suitable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Score Interpretation</h2>
    <p><strong>Miniatures:</strong> Each score is structured as a series of miniatures. A new miniature begins when a poetic text prompt appears, often (but not always) accompanied by an open circle.</p>

    <p><strong>Timing:</strong> Time is assumed to be implied by the horizontal, but the pacing is to be based on the visual context.</p>

    <p><strong>The Open Circle:</strong> When an open circle appears on the score, it indicates propagation - a gestural or motivic idea that is developed along the line. The circle may appear with one or more line segments, suggesting how the musical material might unfold.</p>

    <p><strong>The Line:</strong> The software generates a continuous line from screen to screen. This line is broken up into segments that start with an open circle. The line is a prompt to propagate an idea or gesture from the open circle. Line thickness indicates an amount of something (for example more or fewer pitches/gestures, or more or less volume/sonic richness). The performer is invited to interpret what the line thickness means in their own way. Dashed lines imply a fragmentation of the propagated idea. Dynamics, while implied by line thickness, can also be imposed by the performer so that an idea can fade in and out if this feels appropriate.</p>

    <p><strong>Dots:</strong> Filled dots are for ideas that stand in contradistinction to the main idea. Like line thickness, their size implies amount, but could also be interpreted to mean duration - the amount of time one spends featuring the dot.</p>

    <p><strong>Text Prompts:</strong> The poetic phrases frame each miniature, offering an atmospheric or conceptual entry point for interpretation.</p>

    <p><strong>Development:</strong> Note that the visual proceedures shown here can be further developed through collaboration between the composer and performers.</p>

    <h2>Technical Notes</h2>
    <p>The score generator runs in any modern web browser using JavaScript (p5.js library). It can be displayed in fullscreen mode for practice and performance, making it flexible for various performance contexts. A laptop and projector are recommended for performance use. Screen changes can be made by the performer using page turning pedals.</p>
